# USD/COP and EUR/COP Exchange Rate Prediction

This repository contains code for predicting USD/COP and EUR/COP exchange rates using state-of-the-art time series techniques, including Deep Learning.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to accurately predict future exchange rates of USD/COP and EUR/COP. This is achieved by implementing advanced time series forecasting techniques. The parameters for these techniques are defined in a YAML file, which allows for easy adjustment of the parameters without modifying the code.

## Techniques Used

- Time Series Analysis
- Deep Learning

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary packages.
3. Adjust the parameters in the `params.yml` file as needed. This file contains parameters for data extraction and model training, including the start and end dates and the model order.
4. Run the scripts in the following order:
